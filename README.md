📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation and visual models.

🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the foundational phase of SDLC where developers, stakeholders, and analysts collaborate to identify, document, and structure the needs of a software system. In this project, we simulate a real-world scenario by analyzing requirements for a Booking Management System.

This phase ensures clarity on:

Functional Requirements: What the system must do (e.g., booking, cancellation, user authentication).

Non-Functional Requirements: How the system should perform (e.g., speed, security, scalability).

🚀 Importance in the SDLC
Benefit	Description
✅ Clarity & Alignment	Ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of goals
✅ Risk Reduction	Identifies potential issues early to avoid costly rework
✅ Efficient Planning	Enables accurate estimation of resources and timelines
✅ Quality Assurance	Leads to better testing and validation of the final product
📌 Project Scope: Booking Management System
This system allows users to:

Browse available bookings

Make and cancel reservations

Receive confirmation and notifications

📊 Functional Requirements
Users can create, view, and cancel bookings.

Admins can manage booking inventory and user accounts.

System sends email confirmations upon successful booking.

⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements
System must respond within 2 seconds for any booking action.

Data must be encrypted during transmission.

Platform should support up to 10,000 concurrent users.

🧩 Acceptance Criteria
✅ Users receive confirmation emails within 1 minute of booking.

✅ Booking conflicts are prevented through real-time availability checks.

✅ Admin dashboard loads in under 3 seconds.
